General introduction what the tool is all about: TBW

===USAGE===

pyimc currently supports the following commands:

  * openchat  - show menu with buddies to create a new chat
  * toggle    - toggle the buddy roster (only skype support for now)
  * help      - print help information

Optionally create a configuration file in ~/.pyimcrc. This file can
contain the following settings (following are the default values):

[DEFAULT]
skype = True
pidgin = True
menu = dmenu

For example also see the contrib folder in the downloaded distribution of pyimc

===BUILD===

The pyimc software can be either installed on unix-like systems (including
cygwin) using the build.sh script. Optionally, the path can be directly
set to pyimc/pyimc using the pyimc.py script directly in command line. The
installation process is NOT required!

===DEPLOY===

To deploy the software the following steps have to be done:

1) follow the release guidelines contained in (http://github.com/nvie/gitflow).
   To push the version increase it in setup.py (don't forget to finish and
   update the CHANGELOG file); The releases should tagged with pyimc-VERSION
2) if finished with tagging and releaseing use the dist.sh script to build a
   distribution package
3) upload the pyimc-X.X.X.zip to the github download section

===DEVELOPMENT===

Please use the git-flow workflow for development (http://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
