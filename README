incase = True
xmms = True
bottom = True 
defx = False
x = 680
defy = False

defw = False
w = 240
deffn = False
fn = \"-*-verdana-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1\"
nb = #000000
nf = #9999CC
sb = #000066

===BUILD===

The pyimc software can be either installed on unix-like systems (including cygwin) using the build.sh script. Optionally, the path can be directly set to pyimc/pyimc using the pyimc.py script directly in command line. The installation process is NOT required!

===DEPLOY===

To deploy the software the following steps have to be done:

1) follow the release guidelines contained in (http://github.com/nvie/gitflow). To push the version increase it in setup.py (don't forget to finish and update the CHANGELOG file); The releases should tagged with pyimc-VERSION
2) if finished with tagging and releaseing use the dist.sh script to build a distribution package
3) upload the pyimc-X.X.X.zip to the github download section

===DEVELOPMENT===

Please use the git-flow workflow for development (http://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
